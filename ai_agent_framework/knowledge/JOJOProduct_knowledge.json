      "# ‚öñÔ∏èFunding Rate",
      "Introducing JOJO Funding Rate",
      "### What is Funding Rate?",
      "Funding rates are periodic payments made to either long or short traders, calculated based on the difference between the perpetual contract prices and spot prices. It is designed to prevent long-term discrepancies between perpetual contract markets and spot prices. It is recalculated several times a day ‚Äì JOJO does this every 8 hours.",
      "JOJO provides a clear display of funding rate and a countdown to the next funding period for the convenience of its users.",
      "## How Does Funding Rate Impact Traders?",
      "The impact of funding rates on traders can be significant as funding calculations take into account the amount of leverage used. If a trader uses high leverage and pays for funding, they may suffer losses and end up getting liquidated even in low-volatility markets. Conversely, if a trader collects funding, it can be profitable, particularly in range-bound markets. Therefore, traders can create trading strategies to benefit from funding rates and make profits even in low-volatility markets. Essentially, funding rates are intended to incentivize traders to take positions that maintain perpetual contract prices in line with spot markets.",
      "## How Does It Work?",
      "This model of paying a penalty to the side that deviates from the target price to the side that maintains the target price is the funding fee system of perpetual. Through such reward and punishment measures, the designer of perpetual urges the party whose price deviates in the contract market to adjust, and finally makes the contract price converge with the spot price. In the event of a positive funding rate, it is typical for the perpetual contract price to exceed the mark price. Consequently, traders with long positions must pay for short positions. Conversely, a negative funding rate dictates that short positions must compensate long positions. It is important to note that funding rates are exchanged between peers, and as such, JOJO takes no fees from funding rates as they happen directly between users.",
      "## How are Funding Rates calculated on JOJO?",
      "The Funding Rate is calculated as follows:",
      "F = Clamp (average_P + Clamp(I - average_P, -0.05%, 0.05%) , max_F, min_F )",
      "```\nF = Clamp (average_P + Clamp(I - average_P, -0.05%, 0.05%) , max_F, min_F )\n```",
      "Among them, F = Funding Rate, P= Premium Index, I = Interest Rate, Max_F = Maximum valueÔºàaround 1%Ôºâ, Min_F = Minimum value (around -1%)",
      "There are two components to the Funding Rate: the Interest Rate and the Premium. On JOJO, the default daily interest rate is fixed at 0.03% (0.01% per funding interval, which occurs every 8 hours).",
      "There might be a significant price difference between the perpetual contract and the Mark Price. In such cases, a Premium Index is used to ensure that the prices in both markets converge.",
      "The Premium Index is calculated separately for each contract using the following formula:",
      "Premium Index (P) = [Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price - Impact Ask Price)] / Index Price",
      "```\nPremium Index (P) = [Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price - Impact Ask Price)] / Index Price\n```",
      "Impact Bid Price = The average fill price to execute the Impact Margin Notional on the Bid Price Impact Ask Price = The average fill price to execute the Impact Margin Notional on the Ask Price",
      "Index price means the real-time spot price of the market. It is an average of the prices on the major markets. The value of JOJO's index price is equal to the index price of Binance Perpetual.",
      "Please note that the update of the funding rate will cease if there is a lack of sufficient index price samples. If 80% of the data points are not collected, the funding fee for the eight-hour period will either fail or pass. \"Pass\" indicates that there will be no change in the funding fees for this round, and the calculation will be carried forward to the next eight hours.",

      "How to choose the number of grids in a manual strategy?",
      "JOJO allows you to set the number of grids between 1 and 200.",
      "In grid trading, increasing the number of grids makes them more dense, allowing for trading within smaller price fluctuations. This means that while the profit per grid may be smaller, more frequent trades are triggered due to frequent price fluctuations. On the other hand, reducing the number of grids increases the interval between them, requiring larger price fluctuations to trigger trades. As a result, the profit per grid is relatively higher, but the trigger frequency of trades is reduced.",

      "#### Why are the returns from funding rate arbitrage healthy and sustainable?",
      "Whenever users trade perpetual contracts on any exchange, there is always a cycle of long and short parties paying funding rates to each other. This creates an opportunity for funding rate arbitrage. As trading activity increases and market conditions improve, the APR of funding rate arbitrage will likely rise.",
      "#### Who is paying the APR of Flexible Earn?",
      "On-chain users trading perpetual contracts.",
      "#### What is the funding rate?",
      "The funding rate is used to maintain price equilibrium in perpetual contract trading. It levies a fee on long or short traders based on the difference between the perpetual contract market and the spot price. This fee ensures that the price of perpetual contracts remains aligned with the spot index price. The funding rate is considered to be significant for two reasons:",

      "# ‚ú®Smart Contract Order",
      "## We need a turing complete liquidity model",
      "Typically, a perp dex utilizes either an AMM or an Order Book model. Users are limited to the liquidity mechanisms provided by these platforms.",
      "For instance, in an orderbook prep dex, after depositing funds, you only have the option to place or cancel orders. On an AMM perp dex, you can only deposit tokens to a pool with presetting strategies to provide liquidity.",
      "Is it possible to merge these distinct liquidity models? Or even better, could we accommodate all types of liquidity models?",
      "It is this very idea that has driven us to design the Hybrid Liquidity Model, a Turing-complete liquidity model. This means it can realize any liquidity model you can conceive of.",
      "## Smart Contract Order (SCO)",
      "The hybrid liquidity model is implemented by a novel technique known as \"Smart Contract Order\" (SCO).",
      "You can embed any script into a \"Smart Contract Order\", which will execute upon settlement. This powerful feature enables us to construct any model, pricing curve, or strategy within the same settlement layer.",
      "For instance, if the script calculates order prices based on the current position skew, it will function similarly to an AMM. Conversely, if the script solely verifies an EOA signature, it will operate like an off-chain order book.",
      "## What new features can be realized with SCO ?",
      "### Just in time liquidity",
      "When providing liquidity, there is no need to deposit any funds into JOJO. Only when your order is settled, and the deposit operation is executed in the order script, will it be necessary. In this way, you can use funds that are already in other DeFi protocols to provide liquidity for JOJO while earning interest on them, greatly improving capital efficiency.",
      "### Managed liquidity pools",
      "You can use an order script to build a capital pool that attracts retail investors' funds. The strategy of this capital pool can be freely determined, such as following the Oracle price and market volatility.",
      "### RFQs",
      "RFQ refers to Request for Quote, which is aimed at large transaction users who wish to obtain exclusive liquidity and lock in quotes and counterparty. By using SCO, you can verify the counterparty's address and price within a script to provide exclusive liquidity.",
      "## Surpass Centralized Exchanges",
      "We created JOJO with the conviction that decentralized perpetual trading holds a broader and more promising future than centralized exchanges.",
      "SCO represents one of the best innovations exclusive to a decentralized computational environment. With SCO, JOJO isn't just another typical AMM DEX or orderbook DEX; it's a hybrid liquidity DEX that distinguishes the settlement layer from the liquidity layer. SCO enables developers to devise various liquidity models, thereby enhancing the trading experience like never before.",
      "## Need more documents ?",
      "JOJO introduced SCO in the V1.1 contract, and the relevant developer documentation is still being written. If you are interested, you can contact contact@jojo.exchange to get more information and participate in early development.",
