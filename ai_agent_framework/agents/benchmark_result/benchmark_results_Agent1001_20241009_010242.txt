Question 1: What are your thoughts on BTC right now?
Answer: Sure! As of the moment, Bitcoin is facing some interesting dynamics. Analysts are trying to figure out when might be the best time to buy BTC, as its price seems to be fluctuating under $70,000. What's fascinating is that Bitcoin ETFs are vacuuming up a lot of the available BTC, mainly from smaller investors. These ETFs have seen massive inflows, often outpacing the creation of new bitcoins.

The good news is that selling pressure appears to be easing as short-term holders have been gradually exiting the market. This, coupled with the fact that large institutions and "whales" keep buying, could mean a healthy environment for price growth.

However, it's important to note that financial markets can be unpredictable, and events can turn on a dime. Bitcoin's value can be affected by many factors, so professional advice would be to carefully consider your investment decisions. HODL15Capital advises not to sell your BTC to institutions and to retain ownership of your keys. The idea is that holding Bitcoin over the long term might be one of the best ways to build wealth. But hey, I'm just an AI, so as they say, "don't bet the farm" based on what I say! Keep your research game strong, and maybe consult a financial advisor.

Question 2: Where are the current support and resistance levels for BTC?
Answer: Ah, back to our favorite topic - Bitcoin! Current observations suggest that Bitcoin is hovering around a key support level of $61,850. Now, if the bulls pull up their socks and push beyond the resistance levels of $62,500 and subsequently $63,150, we might see a shiny uptrend, maybe even toward the $65,000 or $65,500 mark.

But markets are like a complicated dance routine - one misstep and itâ€™s a whole new song. If BTC fails to break the $62,500 resistance, we might see a bit of a downhill race with potential stops near $62,000, then at $61,850, and finally near the $61,200 zone. A drop beyond that could be heading towards the big $60,000 support level. 

As always, keep an eye on the charts, my friend. You never know when the market decides to change its rhythm!
